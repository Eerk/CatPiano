# Cat Piano

## This is a Monogame Xamarin project that shows:

- How to work with a separate world.cs class 
- How to read keyboard input and play sounds

## How to use

### With your own github account

- Fork the repository
- Open a terminal in your projects folder and type `git clone https://github.com/_your_own_folder/CatPiano.git` 
- Open the solution file with Xamarin. This should automatically generate the needed files that aren't in the github repository.
- You can now push your own changes back to github either from the terminal, or straight from Xamarin (after entering your github login to Xamarin)

### Without your own github account

- Open a terminal in your projects folder and type `git clone https://github.com/KokoDoko/CatPiano.git` 
- Open the solution file with Xamarin. This should automatically generate the needed files that aren't in the github repository.
- If you want to keep using git you have to change the origin to another url
- Or you can just delete the hidden .git folder

### Just copy the files

If the solution file won't open or won't generate a working project:

- Create a new empty Visual Studio or Xamarin solution named "CatPiano"
- Download this repository as a zip
- Copy the .cs files, images and sounds from the zip file to the corresponding folder in your empty project.
