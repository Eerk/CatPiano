# Cat Piano

## This is a Monogame Xamarin project that shows:

- How to work with a separate world.cs class 
- How to read keyboard input and play sounds

## How to use

- Open a terminal in your projects folder and type `git clone https://github.com/KokoDoko/CatPiano.git`
- Open the solution file with Xamarin. This should automatically generate the needed files that aren't in the github repository.

### Visual Studio

If the above does not work (I have not yet tested with Visual Studio), you can:

- Create a new VS or Xamarin solution named "CatPiano"
- Download the repository as a zip
- Copy the .cs files, images and sounds from the zip file to the corresponding folder in your empty project.
